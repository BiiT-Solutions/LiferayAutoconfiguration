The opposite foot is placed on the ground in-line with the center of the body with the knee flexed. This foot position should be maintained throughout movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a glance</strong>- The athlete should push down with the foot on the floor and extend the hip in order to bring the hips off the ground into a bridge position. The height of the bridge should be limited to where the flexed hip and thigh remain against the chest and the extended hip and thigh remain in an in-line position. This should be performed 3-5 sets at 10-15 repetitions, any asymmetries should be addressed accordingly with sets and reps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- A ball or pillow can be placed between the thigh and chest of the flexed hip in order to provide feedback during the execution of the exercise to maintain hip flexion and passive locking. The foot, knee and thigh of the extended hip must also remain in an in-line position. If the athlete is having hamstring cramping then the foot can be raised onto a step, coreboard or platform to increase hip flexion starting position. Take special note of right and left side asymmetries and address them appropriately with sets and reps.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@11_leg_lock.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
