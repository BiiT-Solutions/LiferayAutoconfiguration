The arms should be extended and reaching overhead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a glance</strong>- Perform abdominal draw. Flex one hip and extend the shoulder opposite of it in an attempt to touch the knee and elbow. The opposite hip and knee should remain in extension. Begin to roll to the side of the flexed hip and knee maintaining close proximity with the knee and elbow. Roll to the side while supporting the head on the opposite, flexed shoulder. Perform 5-15 repetitions for 3-5 sets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- The non-moving leg should remain extended during activity. Close proximity of the moving limbs should be reinforced. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@21_rolling.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
