Extend knees and point toes with feet together. The hands should be placed on the floor with palms up and shoulders should be abducted to 90 degrees and elbows extended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a glance</strong>- Keep one leg in starting position and abduct one leg in order to move hips. Once hips can move independently, move them together. The pelvis should continue to remain flat. Perform 5-15 repetitions for 3-5 sets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- The non-moving foot should remain stable and pointing straight during activity. The lumbar spine should remain flat with the posterior superior iliac spine maintaining contact with the floor. Make sure to begin with small circles and progress without compromising position and stability. The movement should be slow and controlled. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@19_bilateral_hip_flexed.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
