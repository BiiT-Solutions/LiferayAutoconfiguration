Extend knees and point toes with feet together. The hands should be placed on the floor palms up and shoulders should be abducted to 90 degrees and elbows extended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a glance</strong>- Keeping feet together, in clockwise and counterclockwise motion, begin rotating hips and pelvis left and right while keeping shoulders flat. Make an arc of movement as large as possible with no upper body movement. Perform 5-15 repetitions for 3-5 sets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- The hips should be flexed at 90o throughout, and lower only as far as you can control. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@20_hip_flexed_torso.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
