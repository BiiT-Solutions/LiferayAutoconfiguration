The athlete then rotates lower body to the opposite side while maintaining a flat upper back. The hand to which the legs are rotated should be palm down. The partner then internally and externally rotates the shoulder while keeping the slight traction. The stretch is held in each direction for 5-7 seconds and is repeated bilaterally for 3-5 repetitions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- The athlete must maintain a flat upper back during the stretch and traction should be continued throughout the activity. The hips should be flexed greater than 90 degrees throughout the rotation of the legs. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@12_partner_strech_trunk_rotatio.png@@\" width=\"60%\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
