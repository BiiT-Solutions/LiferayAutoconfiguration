Involved leg is lowered off edge of table while maintaining flat lumbar spine with opposite hip remaining flexed passively (athlete or partner holding thigh).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a Glance</strong>- Hip Flexor- Partner presses with his/her hand on anterior thigh downward toward the table. The opposite hand is placed on the athlete’s foot in order to assist the athlete in maintaining a flat lumbar spine. The partner presses the hip into extension for 5-7 seconds. Then the athlete flexes the hip against the slight resistance of the partner’s hand for 3-5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quadriceps</strong>- Partner pushes, with his/her hand on the anterior lower leg, the knee into flexion while the athlete continues to maintain a flat lumbar spine. The partner holds the stretch for 5-7 seconds and then the athlete extends the knee against slight resistance for 3-5 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>These two stretches can be done simultaneously. This is accomplished with the partner using his/her lower leg against the lower leg of the athlete for the quadriceps stretch and using his/her hand against the anterior thigh for the hip flexor stretch. The stretches should be repeated 3-5 times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- Make sure the athlete maintains a flat lumbar spine throughout the exercise. Make sure partner uses proper body positioning in order to make execution of stretch easier. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@8_partner_stetch_modified.png@@\" width=\"60%\" /></p>",
