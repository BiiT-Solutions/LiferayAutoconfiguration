The opposite foot is placed on the floor with the hip flexed to resemble maximal stride position. The partner places his/her hand under the involved side knee (between the table and knee). The other hand is placed on the sacrum of the athlete to stabilize the hips and lumbar spine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a Glance</strong>- The athlete actively flexes the hip against a slight resistance of the partnerâ€™s hand. This is repeated for 3-5 repetitions. The partner then extends the involved hip, passively holding it for a 5-10 second count. The athlete then actively holds the hip in extension and adduction for a 3-5 second count.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cues</strong>- Maintain alignment with the lower extremity and torso. Do not abduct hip during stretch and maintain neutral spine during stretch. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@7_stride_with_spinal.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
