The hip is flexed until a stretch is felt. The stretch is held for 5-7 seconds. The athlete then presses into the partner by extending the hip for 3-5 seconds. The athlete should relax and then the partner increases the stretch slightly. Repeat 3-5 times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- Make sure the athlete maintains proper position. The leg that remains in extension must remain in a neutral position, without external rotation at the hip. The knee must also maintain contact with the table/floor. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"middle\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@14_partner_stretch_straight_leg.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
