The opposite extremity remains extended with the foot flat on the floor. The torso and spine should be in a neutral and erect posture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution at a Glance</strong>- The athlete then flexes the stance knee, enough to feel a stretch in hip. This position is held 5-10 seconds. The spine should stay erect throughout the stretch. This is repeated 3-5 times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety Tips and Verbal Cueing</strong>- A pillow can be placed under the thigh and knee of the flexed hip to decrease pressure on knee and hip. Maintain proper alignment with flexed hip, spine and torso. The flexed hip and knee should be perpendicular to the pelvis. An increased stretch is noted with greatened adduction. Take special note of right and left asymmetries, focusing on the weakness.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"@@6_self_stretches_stride.png@@\" width=\"40%\" /></p>",
